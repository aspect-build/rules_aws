# Bazel rules for Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Integrations for using AWS as a deployment target for Bazel-built artifacts.

This repo is EXPERIMENTAL! We have not yet decided whether to take any long-term commitment to support or maintenance of code here. We may archive and abandon the repo at any time, and may make undocumented breaking changes between releases.

## Installation

From the release you wish to use:
<https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_aws/releases>
copy the WORKSPACE snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file.

To use a commit rather than a release, you can point at any SHA of the repo.

For example to use commit `abc123`:

1. Replace `url = "https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_aws/releases/download/v0.1.0/rules_aws-v0.1.0.tar.gz"` with a GitHub-provided source archive like `url = "https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_aws/archive/abc123.tar.gz"`
1. Replace `strip_prefix = "rules_aws-0.1.0"` with `strip_prefix = "rules_aws-abc123"`
1. Update the `sha256`. The easiest way to do this is to comment out the line, then Bazel will
   print a message with the correct value. Note that GitHub source archives don't have a strong
   guarantee on the sha256 stability, see
   <https://github.blog/2023-02-21-update-on-the-future-stability-of-source-code-archives-and-hashes/>

## Roadmap

Aspect plans to open-source our internal AWS support from our private monorepo.
These features are documented in the issue tracker.
